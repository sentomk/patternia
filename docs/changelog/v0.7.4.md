# Patternia v0.7.4 Release Note

**Release Date:** February 18, 2026  
**Version:** 0.7.4

---

## Overview

Patternia v0.7.4 is a follow-up performance and engineering patch release.
Compared with v0.7.3, this version reduces extra work in guarded/typed match
evaluation paths, expands regression coverage for binding behavior, and
stabilizes variant benchmark and CI verification workflows.

---

## Highlights

### Match Evaluation Performance Refinements
- Guarded-case evaluation now avoids redundant binding work in the matched path.
- Typed-eval variant dispatch now takes a lower-overhead path for zero-bind
  cases.

### Test Coverage Expansion
- Added bind-count regression tests for guarded match flow to validate that
  matched guarded paths bind once (instead of legacy two-bind behavior).
- Added explicit guarded-path sequence checks to keep bind-order semantics
  locked down.

### Variant-Focused Benchmarking
- Added variant-focused microbench coverage for dispatch-sensitive scenarios.
- Registered variant benchmark cases with a stable run profile so cross-run
  comparisons are less noisy.

### CI and Pipeline Improvements
- Added benchmark gate workflow to track benchmark regressions in CI.
- Tightened default CI pipelines for faster and clearer quality feedback.

## Compatibility Notes

- API surface: unchanged for 0.7.x users.
- Source compatibility: unchanged.
- Runtime behavior: same external semantics; internal evaluation paths are
  optimized and validated with new regression tests.
