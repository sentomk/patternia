# Patternia v0.7.0 Release Note

**Release Date:** February 5, 2026  
**Version:** 0.7.0

---

## Overview

Patternia v0.7.0 focuses on variant matching and diagnostics. This release
unifies the type-pattern implementation (`type::is/as/alt`), improves variant
alternative lookup, and tightens compile-time validation with clearer error
messages. Documentation is updated to reflect the refined variant API and
binding/guard semantics.

---

## Highlights

### Variant Matching
- Unified type-pattern implementation (`type::is`, `type::as`, `type::alt`) with
  optional subpatterns.
- Added `type::alt<I>` for index-based variant matching.
- Improved variant alternative lookup using a meta type list (reduced reliance
  on `std::variant` helper types).
- `type::as<T>` sugar for binding the selected alternative.

### Guards and Bindings
- Type patterns that bind can participate in guards.
- Binding/guard behavior and documentation clarified to keep semantics explicit.

### Diagnostics and Validation
- Centralized and shortened static-assert diagnostics for clearer compiler output.
- Wildcard (`__`) unreachable-case detection and validation improved.
- Structural `has<>` members are validated at match-time for accessibility.

---

## API Changes

### `cases(...)` Restrictions (Behavioral Tightening)
`cases(...)` now enforces non-binding patterns only, with explicit diagnostics.
Use `.when(...)` for binding and guard logic.

---

## Documentation Updates

- Variant matching documentation reorganized and expanded.
- `.end()` semantics clarified with respect to `__` fallback.
- Binding/guard and `as<T>()` shorthand documented more clearly.
- Navigation and link consistency fixes across docs.

---

## Compatibility Notes

- If you relied on `cases(...)` with bindings or guards, migrate to `.when(...)`.
- If you used duplicate types in `std::variant`, prefer `type::alt<I>` for
  unambiguous matching.

---

## Implementation Notes (Selected)

- Type-patterns now share a common internal skeleton for consistency.
- Static-assert messages are shorter and more uniform across modules.
- Variant alternative indexing now uses meta utilities (`index_t`) for stronger
  compile-time reasoning.
