# Patternia v0.7.2 Release Note

**Release Date:** February 14, 2026
**Version:** 0.7.2

---

## Overview

Patternia v0.7.2 is a diagnostics and correctness patch release focused on
deterministic unreachable-case detection for `type::alt<I>()` case ordering.
This release does not change runtime matching semantics.

---

## Highlights

### Deterministic Unreachable `type::alt<I>()` Diagnostics
- Added compile-time detection for unreachable alt cases caused by ordering:
  when a plain `type::alt<I>()` appears first, any later `type::alt<I>(...)`
  case is now diagnosed as unreachable.
- Builder `.when(...)` diagnostics are scoped to the newly appended case to
  avoid cascading duplicate errors on subsequent chained cases.
- `cases(...)` performs full-pack unreachable checks consistently.

### Diagnostics Infrastructure Improvements
- Added internal alt-index extraction for both plain and guarded alt patterns.
- Unified unreachable-case reporting under a dedicated diagnostic path in
  `diagnostics.hpp`.

---

## Compatibility Notes

- Source compatibility: unchanged.
- API surface: unchanged.
- Behavior change: compile-time diagnostics are stricter for deterministic
  unreachable `type::alt<I>()` ordering.

---

## Implementation Notes (Selected)

- `include/ptn/core/common/diagnostics.hpp`
  - Added alt-index analysis traits and unreachable-after-plain-alt checker.
  - Added targeted builder check (`new case` only) and full-pack check.
- `include/ptn/core/engine/detail/builder_impl.hpp`
  - `.when(...)` now validates newly added case reachability for alt ordering.
- `include/ptn/core/dsl/ops.hpp`
  - `cases(...)` now validates full alt-order reachability.
