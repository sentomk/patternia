**Release Date:** February 18, 2026  
**Version:** 0.7.5  
**Type:** Hotfix

---

## Overview

Patternia v0.7.5 is a hotfix release for v0.7.4. It fixes a benchmark
registration issue that can fail compilation on MinGW toolchains.

---

## What Is Fixed

### Benchmark Registration Compatibility (MinGW)
- Replaced `apply_stable_variant_profile(BENCHMARK(...))` registration style
  with direct `BENCHMARK(...)->...` chained configuration.
- Preserved the same stable variant benchmark profile:
  nanosecond unit, minimum run time, repetitions, and aggregate-only reporting.

### Benchmark Warning Cleanup
- Updated the alternating-hot variant microbench path to avoid the deprecated
  const-reference `DoNotOptimize` usage.

---

## Impact

- API surface: unchanged.
- Runtime semantics: unchanged.
- Build behavior: benchmark target now compiles on MinGW where v0.7.4 could
  fail.

---

## Implementation Notes

- `bench/bench_match_variant.cpp`
  - Fixed benchmark macro registration pattern for compatibility.
  - Kept benchmark profile semantics unchanged.
