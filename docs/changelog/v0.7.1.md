# Patternia v0.7.1 Release Note

**Release Date:** February 7, 2026
**Version:** 0.7.1

---

## Overview

Patternia v0.7.1 is a diagnostics-focused patch release. This version improves
compile-time error readability and adds direct fix hints for common misuse
cases. No runtime behavior or matching semantics changed.

---

## Highlights

### Clearer Static-Assert Requirements
- Replaced generic requirement names such as `ok` with semantic names
  (for example `can_add_after_wildcard`, `alt_index_in_range`,
  `pattern_has_bind_method`).
- Compiler diagnostics now expose more meaningful failed requirements.

### Actionable Error Hints
- Added concise `Tip:` guidance to key diagnostics in match builder validation.
- Improved guidance for wildcard placement, `.end()`/`.otherwise()` misuse,
  and lvalue subject requirements.

### Variant Type Diagnostics
- Improved `type::is<T>()` not-found diagnostics with clearer wording and
  concrete recovery guidance.
- Added explicit guidance for duplicate variant alternatives:
  prefer `type::alt<I>()` or distinct wrapper types.

---

## Compatibility Notes

- Source compatibility: unchanged.
- API surface: unchanged.
- Behavior: unchanged (diagnostic wording only).

---

## Implementation Notes

- `include/ptn/core/common/diagnostics.hpp`
  - Requirement names made semantic.
  - Several static-assert messages now include fix-oriented hints.
- `include/ptn/pattern/type.hpp`
  - `type::is<T>()` alternative lookup diagnostics refined.
