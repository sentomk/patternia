# Patternia v0.7.6 Release Note

**Release Date:** February 20, 2026  
**Version:** 0.7.6

---

## Overview

Patternia v0.7.6 is a performance and benchmarking release focused on variant
dispatch internals, practical benchmark coverage, and easier benchmark result
visualization.

Compared with v0.7.5, this version adds targeted fast paths for variant
matching (including mixed simple + guarded patterns), introduces real-world
benchmark scenarios, and streamlines single-file benchmark reporting.

---

## Highlights

### Variant Dispatch Performance (Core)
- Added a single-dispatch fast path for simple variant cases.
- Specialized simple dispatch by active variant index to reduce per-case
  matching overhead.
- Added prefiltering for mixed simple + guarded variant patterns so guarded
  branches can skip irrelevant alternatives early.
- Simplified internal index-resolution flow for typed variant dispatch.

### Real-World Variant Benchmarks
- Added protocol-router scenario benchmarks.
- Added command-parser scenario benchmarks.
- For each scenario, included side-by-side implementations for:
  - Patternia
  - if-else
  - switch-case
  - std::visit

### Benchmark Tooling and Visualization
- Added `scripts/bench_single_report.py` for single-JSON visualization across
  multiple implementations in the same scenario.
- The script outputs chart + markdown + csv summaries to simplify local
  analysis and sharing.

### Documentation Refresh
- Moved latest benchmark snapshot to the top of README for faster
  performance-oriented access.
- Updated benchmark workflow docs with single-file visualization commands.

## Compatibility Notes

- API surface: unchanged for 0.7.x users.
- Source compatibility: unchanged.
- Runtime semantics: unchanged externally; optimizations are internal to
  variant evaluation and benchmark tooling.
